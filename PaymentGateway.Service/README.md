# Application

This layer is the Application Layer of my the project.
This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers and contain Service Layers, CommandHandlers and Query Handlers.
This layer doesn't have any dependencies to the Infrastracture Layer, instead it only communicates via Domain Layer.
